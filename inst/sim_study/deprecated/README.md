# Deprecated: uncombined sim study scripts

These scripts are the original local/cluster split versions of the simulation study.

**Use instead:** the unified `../sim_study.R` (one level up), which supports both local and cluster via `--small`, SLURM detection, and `--cluster` for interactive runs on the cluster login node (or `run_sim_study.sh --cluster`).

- `sim_study_local.R` – old local run
- `sim_study_cluster.R` – old cluster run

Kept here for reference only.
