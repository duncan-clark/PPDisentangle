\title{Normalize a vector of log-weights to proper weights summing to 1}
\usage{
normalize_weights(w)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{Numeric vector of log-weights (e.g. log-likelihoods)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of same length as \code{w}, summing to 1
}
\description{
Uses the log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability.
Non-finite inputs (e.g. -Inf) receive zero weight.
Returns uniform weights if all finite values are identical.
